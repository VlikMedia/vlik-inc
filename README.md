# Vlik
Vlik is an independent video-sharing platform that is currently under development. The service was initially created as an alternative web-based front-end for YouTube. Over time, it has evolved into a standalone platform with its own features, though it remains in an early stage of development. Vlik aims to provide users with more flexibility and control compared to existing mainstream video services.
