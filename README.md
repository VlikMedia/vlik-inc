# Vlik
"Vlik is a third-party web-based front-end for YouTube, designed as an alternative interface for browsing and viewing video content.
It was launched in December 2025 and is developed by an independent developer known by the pseudonym Saucepan.
Vlik operates by indexing a limited subset of YouTube content rather than providing access to the full platform.
As of its initial release, the service maintains a relatively small index, with plans for expansion stated by its developer.
The project is maintained independently and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Google or YouTube."
